                    <p class="para"> The Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network is a program that provides data on the quality of stream water networks across 
                        Ontario and covers a wide range of parameters. The current interface provided for displaying the data is designed to show
                        active versus inactive stations on a map and give spatial context to people exploring its accompanying open source datasets but it
                        does not go further than that. The data collected through this program has the potential to play a role in engaging the 
                        general public with water quality and protection issues. The lack of a platform that clearly displays collected data in a way that is accessible for 
                        the general public alongside more information about the importance of water quality is a problem. The data that comes from programs like these is invaluable and 
                        the continued funding of existing programs as well as funding being allocated to new programs can come through public pressure on legislation. </p>
