            <p class="paramargin"> Welcome to Web Foxtrot's Project page. The team consists of 4 peers who asked an important question:</p>

            <p class="prettybox"> Why should we care about water quality and water quality monitoring initiatives? </p>
            <img class="imagecentre" src="Images/Water/watermonitor.jpg" alt="Mrs Hemlock taking water samples">

            <p class="paramargin">
                The question was then recreated as a problem statement, and a web based solution was developed in response to it. The GEOM 99 learning goals require
                WebFoxTrot to explore web technology in GIS by applying it to address the above stated problem.
                This assignment mirrors how such a solution would be implemented based on a real need in a municipal or consulting role.</p>

            <!-- add in the goal section KS april 6 & 18 AH Edit 19/04/2022-->
            <p class="paramargin">The goal was to create a solution which educates and engages! This is an Esri Dashboard to display the collected data along with a summarization of important water quality parameters. Alongside 
                this Dashboard will be an Esri StoryMap to communicate the reason the program exists as well as general information about water quality 
                monitoring programs.</p>

                <h2>Explained</h2>
                <p>Water quality monitoring programs are a vital tool to help improve local waters. 
                It is the process of testing and assessing water to make ensure there is compliance with drinking water standards 
                and helps alert us to on-going problems that could effect the health of our communities. </p>
                
                <p>It goes far beyond simply protecting our drinking water. 
                In Canada, we are lucky to hold 20% of all the worldâ€™s freshwater in the Great Lakes. It and the St. Lawrence River Ecosystem break
                down our wastes, reduce the risks of flood damage, provide food resources, and help moderate extreme weather.</p>

                <p>Since all aquatic ecosystems depend on the quality of our water, and many different factors can impact the health of our waterways, 
                the obvious conclusion is that we need water monitoring and water monitoring education in order to protect our most valuable resource.</p>

            <h2>Background of Existing Data and Solutions</h2>

            <p class="paramargin">Ontario has 36 conservation authorities which are divided by watersheds. They are responsible for those stations that fall within 
                their boundaries, with community members, volunteers and community organizations supporting the collection of data which would inform management decisions.
                 The Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network (PWQMN) is the primary partnership for data collection and will be the
                focus of our solution.</p>
            

            <p class="paramargin">  Data from the PWQMN provide vital information on the quality of stream water networks across 
            Ontario and covers a wide range of parameters. The current interface provided for displaying the data is designed to show
            active versus inactive stations on a map and give spatial context to people exploring its accompanying open source datasets but it
            does not go any further than that. The data collected through this program has the potential to play a role in engaging the 
            general public with water quality and protection issues. </p>
            
            <p class="paramargin">  The lack of accessible and engaging information for the general public is a problem. The data that comes from programs like these is invaluable for
            the continued funding of existing programs as well as funding being allocated to new programs via public pressure on legislation. The image on the right 
            shows the current display for water stations that are part of the program. </p>
