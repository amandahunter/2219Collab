        <h1>Geom 99 and the Question</h1>
        <p class="paramargin"> Welcome to Web Foxtrot's Project page. The team consists of 4 peers who asked an important question:</p>

        <p class="prettybox"> Why should we care about water quality and water quality monitoring initiatives? </p>

        <p class="paramargin">
            The question we then posed as a problem statement, and the solution was created in response to it as a web based solution. The GEOM 99 learning goals require
             WebFoxTrot to explore web technology in GIS by applying it to address the above stated problem.
            This assignment mirrors how such a solution would be implemented based on a real need in a municipal or
            consulting role.</p>

            <h1 class="prob1">Explained</h1>

        <p class="paramargin">Water quality monitoring programs are a vital tool to help improve local waters. 
            It is the process of testing and assessing water to make ensure there is compliance with drinking water standards 
            and helps alert us to on-going problems that could effect the health of our communities.</p>

        <p class="paramargin">Though protecting safe drinking water is a major reason for water quality monitoring, it goes far beyond that. 
            In Canada, we are lucky to hold 20% of all the worldâ€™s freshwater in the Great Lakes. It and the St. Lawrence River Ecosystem break
             down our wastes, reduce the risks of flood damage, provide food resources and recreation activities, help moderate extreme weather, 
             and purify our water and air. </p>
             
        <p class="paramargin">Since all aquatic ecosystems depend on the quality of our water, and many different factors can impact the health of our waterways, 
        the obvious conclusion is that we need water monitoring and water monitoring education in order to protect our most valuable resource. </p>

        <h1 class="prob1">Water Quality Monitoring</h1>
        <p class="paramargin">In smaller municipalities, the number of staff dedicated to monitoring water health is quite limited. 
            The amount of tasks in these roles far outweigh the capacity required for very thorough data collection. It falls to the community members, 
            volunteers and community organizations to collect additional data which inform management decisions on the local, state, and even national level. 
            The sharing of data is crucial to ensuring that areas of concern, especially in more remote areas are adequately determined.  </p>
        
            
             
        <h1 class="probl"> Background</h1>
        <p class="para"> The Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network is a program that provides data on the quality of stream water networks across 
        Ontario and covers a wide range of parameters. The current interface provided for displaying the data is designed to show
         active versus inactive stations on a map and give spatial context to people exploring its accompanying open source datasets but it
        does not go further than that. The data collected through this program has the potential to play a role in engaging the 
        general public with water quality and protection issues. </p>
                    <p class = "para">    
                        The lack of a platform that clearly displays collected data in a way that is accessible for 
                        the general public alongside more information about the importance of water quality is a problem. The data that comes from programs like these is invaluable and 
                        the continued funding of existing programs as well as funding being allocated to new programs can come through public pressure on legislation.The image on the right 
                        shows the current display for water stations that are part of the program.

                        <p class="para1"> To create an Esri Dashboard to display the collected data along with a summarization of important water quality parameters. Alongside 
                        this Dashboard will be an Esri StoryMap to communicate the reason the program exists as well as general information about water quality 
                        monitoring programs </p>
