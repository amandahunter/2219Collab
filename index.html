            <h1 class = "probk"> Background</h1>

            <p class = para> The Provincial Water Quality Monitoring Network is a program that provides data on the quality of stream water networks across 
                Ontario and covers a wide range of parameters. The current interface provided for displaying the data is designed to show
                active versus inactive stations on a map and give spatial context to people exploring its accompanying open source datasests but it
                does not go further than that. The data collected through this program has the potentional to play a role in engaging the 
                general public with water quality and protection issues. The lack of a platform that clearly displays collected data in a way that is accessible for 
                the general public alongside more information about the importance of water quality is a problem. The data that comes from programs like these is invaluable and 
                the continued funding of existing programs as well as funding being allocated to new programs can come through public pressure on legistlation. </p>

    <!-- goal for the problem statement KS april 6  -->
    <div class = problemintro>
        <h2 class = probk>Goal: </h2>
       <p class = para> To create an Esri Dashboard to display the collected data along with a summarization of imporant water quality parameters. Alongside 
           this Dashboard will be an Esri StoryMap to communicate the reason the program exists as well as general information about water quality 
           monitoring programs </p>
