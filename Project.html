                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <h3> A summary of the statement here </h3>
                <h2>Ideal</h2>
                <p>Providing the general public of Ontario access to water quality monitoring 
                    data from the Provincial(Stream) Water Quality Monitoring Network. This would be of 
                    benefit as it increases interest in water quality and encourages actions to improve 
                    environmental conditions.  Encourage participation in water security initiatives whether 
                    that be legislative or environmental rebate programs for home and community improvements. </p>
                <h2>Reality</h2>
                <p>A well designed map and hub for accessing this location does not currently exist for 
                    Ontarians. People may be unaware of why they should care about the water quality in 
                    their area or unsure of their own agency in this topic. </p>
                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p>The lack of accessibility to this data would cause people to continue to be uneducated 
                    about existing water quality monitoring programs. This may lead to them feeling detached 
                    from water security initiatives.</p>
                <h2>Proposal</h2> 
                <p>An ESRI dashboard will be created to display the Provincial(Stream) Water Quality Monitoring 
                    Data for Ontario, specifically the water monitoring station locations and the 2021 data for 
                    those stations. It will come from the governments open data portal. The dashboard will include
                    a well designed interactive map as well as display a summarization of 5 major water quality 
                    monitoring variables.  A story map will also be created to describe the process of creating the 
                    dashboard as well as general information about this specific water quality monitoring program. 
                    This storymap will allow the public to feel more involved in the creation process to foster a 
                    better understanding of how the program works, it's benefits to their lives and how they can be 
                    involved with water security issues.</p>

                    <ol class = pDash>
                        <li> Data was downloaded from Ontario's Open data portal. The data sets chosen were:  one shp file 
                             that showed all of the stations, both active and inactive, and one excel file with collection data for 2020
                        </li>
                        <li> The collection dataset had no data location attached so it was joined to the shp file of stations. After this was done 
                            the XY Table to point tool was used so it could be mapped. Then a set of a parameters that we wished to 
                            represent were selected to create a new feature layer. The parameters selected were: Dissolved oxygen,
                             PH, water temperature, nitrogen, phosphate and e. coli.
                        </li>
                        <li> This layer with station location and collection data for our selected parameters was exported to ArcGIS Online 
                            and a map was created to be embedded in the dashboard </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3> Step Two: Dashboard</h3>
                    <p> As the StoryMap will be doing the job of giving background information on water quality monitoring issues, 
                        and this program in particular the intended focus of the Dashboard was conveying information about data collected 
                        at individual stations. The class of widgets used can be split into dynamic vs static. 
                    </p>  
                   
                    <div class = static>
                        <h4>Static</h4>
                        <p class = pdash1 >The static elements are an indicator that shows the number of stations and number of years that 
                            the program has been running (a)and a reference to recommended water levels (b). The indicator is a ready-to-use widget option 
                            within the Dashboard enviornment.The numerical references use Arcade scripting, this way if records are added 
                            to the dataset it can be updated automatically (c). The water level data was added in using the rich text widget.

                        <h4>Dynamic</h4>
                        <p class = pdash1> The dynamic elements of the map change once the end user chooses a station. It will then tell them how many years 
                            the station has been active, what types of collection has happened there and finally the data table of results
                            The Dashboard functionality that was used to make this happen was using layer actions. Layer actions allow you to choose 
                            widgets on the Dashboard to be targeted in different ways when a selection is made. The map was the main layer that was configured 
                            and the indicator, pie chart and data table were the targets. When a station is chosen the data is filtered and the targets show the 
                            corresponding data.

    <!-- dicoveries and limitations for the dashboard section KS april 19-->
                    <h3> Discoveries and Limitations</h3>   
                    <p> ArcGIS Dashboards gave us the ability to display the map alongside key data points that we thought fit into the overall 
                        theme. Integrating the map was simple as it was created in ArcGIS Online so it was readily available as a widget item to be 
                        added into the map. The other widgets were also easy enough to add to the layout and move around to suit our needs. The ease of
                        making configurations came at the expense of certain customizations. For example the header does not allow you to chose the text position, 
                        since we wanted it central we used the rich text option, but this mean in order to have the link out to the storymap and source data we still 
                        needed to have the header in there. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p> 
                        The design of the Dashboard was centered around the user interacting with it when they click on a station.
                        Before this happens the Dashboard looks quite empty, especially in the dynamic column, but it was decided that this was okay because it was 
                        easily resolved with interaction. A limitation we faced is that there is no way for the dashboard to default to this selection mode.
                        The interaction that fills the dashboard is dependent on the end-user knowing that they couldn't just click on the stations but 
                        instead first had to click the selection tool and then make their selection. We tried to remedy this by including instructions plus a 
                        picture of the select tool below the map, but it's acknowledged that it isn't the most intuitive user interface. 
                    </p>

                <div> Using Esri Story Map functionality, we were able to create and house an area where we will be able to fully tell our story. The steps below show how the story map was created:</div>
