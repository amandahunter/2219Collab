                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <h3> A summary of the statement here </h3>
                <h2>Ideal</h2>
                <p>Providing the general public of Ontario access to water quality monitoring 
                    data from the Provincial(Stream) Water Quality Monitoring Network. This would be of 
                    benefit as it increases interest in water quality and encourages actions to improve 
                    environmental conditions.  Encourage participation in water security initiatives whether 
                    that be legislative or environmental rebate programs for home and community improvements. </p>
                <h2>Reality</h2>
                <p>A well designed map and hub for accessing this location does not currently exist for 
                    Ontarians. People may be unaware of why they should care about the water quality in 
                    their area or unsure of their own agency in this topic. </p>
                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p>The lack of accessibility to this data would cause people to continue to be uneducated 
                    about existing water quality monitoring programs. This may lead to them feeling detached 
                    from water security initiatives.</p>
                <h2>Proposal</h2> 
                <p>An ESRI dashboard will be created to display the Provincial(Stream) Water Quality Monitoring 
                    Data for Ontario, specifically the water monitoring station locations and the 2021 data for 
                    those stations. It will come from the governments open data portal. The dashboard will include
                    a well designed interactive map as well as display a summarization of 5 major water quality 
                    monitoring variables.  A story map will also be created to describe the process of creating the 
                    dashboard as well as general information about this specific water quality monitoring program. 
                    This storymap will allow the public to feel more involved in the creation process to foster a 
                    better understanding of how the program works, it's benefits to their lives and how they can be 
                    involved with water security issues.</p>

                        <li> The collection data had no data location attached so it was joined 
                             to the shp file of stations to be mapped 
                        </li>
                        <li> Map was created in ArcGIS Online to show the data </li>

                <div>
                    Using Esri Story Map functionality, we were able to create and house an area where we will be able to fully tell our story. The steps below show how the story map was created:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Created a Custom Story Map Theme</li>
                        <li> Created the flow of how the story should be told, answering all of the major questions to help viewers understand how important water quality is.
                        </li>
                        <li> Inserted the important information into the appropriate headings.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This Story Map was made to be simple and to make information digestable for the audience, therefore, the sections are only meant to be summaries of the majoy information.
